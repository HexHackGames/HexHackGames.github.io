	      <p> PROXY (1.0) is a response to one of our previous projects, COGNIZANCE. It is a commentary on the fear of an artist working a “dull desk job” as their own creations surpass and leave them. Within the story Erik creates Hexen illegally as his statement of rebellion against his employers at Fractured Haze, as it's against company policies for employees to input themselves into the realities provided by the corporation. Throughout the experience, we see Hexen break free from his “prison” and into the System in search of Erik. This is a take on how our ambition wishes to achieve the grand visualization we see in our heads but slips away due to other constraints, in this case the fact that Erik is at work and cannot commit to his creative practice causes it to slip through the cracks. </p>

 <p>Both COGNIZANCE and PROXY (1.0) reflect on our journey as students, with emphasis on every unexpected twist and turn that we have run into over the years. This piece focuses on the stressful and repetitive nature of trying to get elements of a project to work with little guidance throughout the process. As New Media students we are given a phenomenal base in which we can branch out and use new concepts and techniques to incorporate into our projects, however as our ambitions grow there is only so much assistance we can receive from our professors and peers and at that time it is up to us to gauge how we pursue a project.</p>
